# CT_G42_unibot
## TO-DO
- Rewrite the catcher conditionals in the case that the detector fails to detect a topic
- Add more words so that the detector can more reliably detect topics
- Add in the actual datasets so we have full functionality
- Fix the issue where the tree parser prints an additional line after finishing in some cases

##  CHANGES
- The tree parser is largely different from the pseudocode and flowchart version as I didn't expect to meet some difficulties
- Added the failure condition that exists in the flowchart but not in the pseudocode
