# CT_G42_unibot
## TO-DO
- Add more words so that the detector can more reliably detect topics
- Add in the actual datasets so we have full functionality
- Add a quit option

##  CHANGES
- The tree parser is largely different from the pseudocode and flowchart version as I didn't expect to meet some difficulties
- Added the failure condition that exists in the flowchart but not in the pseudocode
